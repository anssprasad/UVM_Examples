  src/uvm_register.svh

--------------------------------------       
Topics: uvm_register-2.0 March 2, 2010 
--------------------------------------       
New files:
  uvm_broadcast_register.svh
  uvm_indirect_register.svh

Updated examples
  11_masking_notification

New examples:
  14_register_map_lookup
  15_backdoor
  16_apb_zin
  17_broadcast_registers
  18_ap_notification
  19_constraints
  20_simple_indirect

Adds support for:
  - Hierarchical address maps
  - Register alias names
  - Add a register file into a register file.

Compatibility Issues:
  New Register Inheritance
    In register definitions, the register parent used to
    be 'uvm_component'. It is now 'uvm_named_object'.
    You must change the register construction definition:

    Old:
    <   function new(string name, uvm_component p);
    New:
    >   function new(string name, uvm_named_object p);

  Lightweight analysis ports

  Constructor arguments.
  Creating registers using the factory.

  reset() uses poke() now instead of write().

  ReadOnly bits can be updated by the shadow.....???????

Versions supported:
  - Tested on Questa 6.4[a,b,c,d,e] and 6.5[a,b].
  - Tested on Windows and Linux. 
  - Tested with UVM 2.0, UVM 2.0.1 and UVM 2.0.2.

New in 1.0 Beta 9:
  + Hierarchical register maps
  + "Alias" names for registers

Changes in 1.0 beta 9:
  bus_read_bv() message changed to be more informative.


--------------------------------------       
Topics: uvm_register-1.0 Beta 8 June 29, 2009
--------------------------------------       

New files:
    + src/uvm_coherent_register.svh
    + src/uvm_fifo_register.svh
    + src/uvm_memory.svh
    + src/uvm_register_macros.svh

Adds support for:
    + coherent registers
    + fifo registers
    + semaphore locking
    + simple memory interface
    + field access "by name"

  Extends support for various field and register
  permissions and usages. For example a field can now
  have "RW" permission when accessed from one bus, and
  "RO" permission when accessed from another bus.

  --------------------------------
  - Added support for simple memory api (See 09_memory_simple).
  - Added support for coherent registers (See 10_coherent_registers).
  - Added support for more access policies and for 
    register permissions based on address. 
    (11_masking_notification)
  - Added support for fifo registers (12_fifo_registers).
  - Added support for "by name" access to fields 
    (13_field_by_name).

  - NO API changes which break backward compatibility.

Versions supported:
  - Tested on Questa 6.4a, 6.4b, 6.4c and 6.5.
  - Tested on Windows and Linux. 
  - Tested with UVM 2.0 and UVM 2.0.1.

New in 1.0 Beta 8:
  + Coherent register types

  + FIFO register types

  + Simple Semaphore locking on registers

  + Field Access By Name

  + Simple Memory API.
    Memory functionality will be expanded in a future release
    with backward compatible API.

  + Assigning register access policy based on address.
    Adds support for registers which have one kind
    of permission when they are accessed via bus 1,
    and another kind of permission when they are accessed via
    bus 2. For example, regA is RW on the AHB bus, but RO
    on the I2C bus.

Changes in 1.0 beta 8:

  + Enhanced field and register access policies.
    The complete list is now RW, RO, WO, 
    Clear-on-Read, Set-on-Read, Write-Zero-to-Set
    and Write-One-to-Clear.


--------------------------------------       
Topics: uvm_register-1.0 Beta 7 March 26, 2009
--------------------------------------       

  Adds support for backdoor access, an id register implementation
  and a modal register implementation.

  --------------------------------
  - Added support for library backdoor access and test (05_backdoor_simple).
  - Added example 'id_register' implementation and test (06_id_registers).
  - Added a modal register implementation and test (08_register_field_modes)
  - Normalized some API function names.
  - NO API changes.

  --------------------------------
  - Tested on Questa 6.4a, 6.4b, 6.4c and 6.5.
  - Tested on Windows and Linux. 
  - Tested with UVM 2.0 and UVM 2.0.1.

New in 1.0 Beta 7:
 
 + Added backdoor access support via a C implementation.
   If you want to use backdoor access, then you must compile 
   the DPI C code. (Pre-compiled libraries for linux, 
   linux_x86_64 and cygwin are shipped with the library)
   (There is a makefile provided, but you may need to modify to
   suit).

:    vlog +incdir+$(UVM_HOME)/src+$(UVM_REGISTER_HOME)/src \
:      +define+BACKDOOR_DPI \
:      $(UVM_REGISTER_HOME)/src/uvm_register_pkg.sv

 + Added new examples

   05_backdoor_simple:
   05_backdoor_simple is a simple example of using the
   shadow register to write directly to an HDL path name.
   (via the PLI - a backdoor into the design).

   06_id_register: 
   06_id_register is an example of a special functionality
   in a register - an ID register. This ID register is not
   a general purpose register, but is provided to use as
   is or as a demonstration of how to create your own
   special purpose register functionality. See
   uvm_id_register.svh

   08_register_field_modes:
   08_register_field_modes is an example of a special functionality
   in a register - a modal register. This modal register is
   a register whose field representation changes depending on which
   mode it is in. It is provided as a demonstration of using
   modes. It is expected that most modal registers are customer
   specific, and so this modal register and example serves
   as a template for customization.

Changes in 1.0 beta 7:
  + Changed uvm_register-1.0beta7/src/uvm_register.svh

    Added backdoor access support.

    Normalized names. Raw access is peek_*() or poke_*().
      Masked access is read_data32() or write_data32()
      (set_data32() still exists but is 
       deprecated in favor of peek_data32())

    Added get_byte_array_no_masking().

    Cleaned up error messaging.
  
  + Added uvm_register-1.0beta7/src/uvm_register_dpi.c
    and   uvm_register-1.0beta7/src/uvm_register_dpi.svh

    Backdoor implementation.
  
  + Changed uvm_register-1.0beta7/src/uvm_register_env_pkg.svh

    Message printing fixed.
  
--------------------------------------       
Topic: uvm_register-1.0 Beta 6 January 16, 2009
--------------------------------------       

   Added additional examples. Instrumented library with MACROS. 
   NO API changes.

  --------------------------------
  - Tested on Questa 6.4a, 6.4b, 6.4c and 6.5 Beta.
  - Tested on Windows and Linux. 
  - Tested with UVM 2.0 and UVM 2.0.1.

New in 1.0 Beta 6:
  Added new examples 
    02_register_transactions
    03_layered_sequences
    04_simple_bus
  
  01_bus_transactions contains new sequences and interesting
  constraints. All register fields can be random in this 
  example.
  
  02_register_transactions is simple example that builds a
  driver and a sequencer for register transactions. Register
  sequence is started, and the register driver prints them.
  
  03_layered_register_sequences is a simple example that
  builds a layer of register transactions over bus 
  transactions. The register transactions generated from the 
  automatic test are converted into bus specific transactions.
  
  04_simple_bus is a simple example that shows a bus with
  an OVC-style component integrated to a register test.

Changes in 1.0 beta 6:

  Library components changes:

  Added factory registration for all library components.
  Added field automation.

  - Changed auto test default sequence name from
      register_sequence_all_registers_REQ_RSP
    to
      register_sequence_all_registers#(REQ, RSP)

  - uvm_register.svh: 
    Removed 'class uvm_register_monitor' (not used)

  - uvm_register_agent_pkg.svh:
    Changed the name of uvm_register_scoreboard 
      to uvm_register_monitor.

  - uvm_register_env_pkg.svh:
    Instantiated a register_bus_monitor to publish
    register transactions to the built in scoreboard.

  Copyrights adjusted from 2008 to 2009.
  Changed base type of uvm_register_bus_driver 
    from uvm_threaded_component to uvm_component.
  Changed base type of uvm_register_auto_test
    from uvm_threaded_component to uvm_component.
    

--------------------------------------       
Topic: uvm_register-1.0 Beta 5 December 22, 2008
--------------------------------------       

General housecleaning. Added NaturalDocs automated
documentation generation.

- Tested on Questa 6.4, 6.4a, 6.4b, 6.4c and 6.5 Beta 1.
- Tested on Windows and Linux. 
- Tested with UVM 2.0 and UVM 2.0.1.

Package name changed to 'uvm_register_pkg'.
Use it as
  import uvm_register_pkg::*;

Added Natural Docs comments to allow HTML documentation
generation.

Future development plans (suggestions/priority welcome):
  1) Example register verification on an XBUS OVC.
  2) Backdoor access.
  3) Auto-generation of SystemVerilog register definitions
     from a standard format.
  4) Memory support.
