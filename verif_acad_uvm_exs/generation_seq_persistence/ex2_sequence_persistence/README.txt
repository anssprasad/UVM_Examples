This example shows how to use variables within sequence objects which persist
until the sequence object is dereferenced, this is sometimes referred to as
chaining sequences, using information within one sequence to determine what to
do or where to start with another during stimulus generation.

To compile and run the simulation, please use the make file:

make all - Compile and run
make build - Compile only
make run  - Run the simulation in command line mode

The Makefile assumes the use of Questa 10.0b or a later version
with built-in support for the UVM
