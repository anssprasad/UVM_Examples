This example shows how to use interrupt sequences to control parallel processing
hardware which generates interrupts when different blocks complete their
processing tasks.

To compile and run the simulation, please use the make file:

make all - Compile and run
make build - Compile only
make sim  - Run the simulation in command line mode

The Makefile assumes the use of Questa 10.0b or a later version with built-in
UVM support
