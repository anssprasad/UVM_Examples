OVM REGISTER - OVM Register Package
-----------------------------------

 The OVM Register package provides base class
 functionality for use as part of a shadow register 
 verification environment.

 The OVM Register package requires an OVM installation
 in order to run. If you do not already have the OVM,
 you should download and unpack it from <http://www.ovmworld.org>.

The OVM Register Library Examples:


o examples/registers/00_stopwatch/ 

  A simple example using automatic testing 
  demonstrating a shadow register.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   auto/stopwatch_register_pkg.sv - The "automatically" 
                                    generated code. Today the 
                                    automation code is not yet
                                    released. This code must 
                                    be created by some means -
                                    typing, custom perl 
                                    script, etc.

   dut/stopwatch_rtl.sv           - The RTL

   dut/stopwatch_rtl_wrapper.sv   - SV interface to the RTL

   t.sv                           - Top level test. 
                                    What the user MUST write.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/01_bus_transactions/  

  A simple example showing generation of bus transactions.
  Constraints are demonstrated.


   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   t.sv                           - Main classes. Top-level.
   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/02_register_transactions/  

  A simple example showing generation of register transactions.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/03_layered_register_sequences/  

  An example showing a bus driver, bus sequencer and
  bus transaction. A layered system is built with a
  specialized sequencer and special sequence (translate_sequence)
  which translates a register sequence into a bus sequence.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   t.sv                           - Main classes. Top-level.
   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/04_simple_bus/  

  An example showing an OVC designed for the "simple_bus".
  The OVC is used to drive and monitor the simple bus.
  A register translation sequence (translate_seq) is
  used to translate from generic register bus transactions
  into protocol specific simple_bus bus transactions.

  See RegisterPackageOverSimpleBus.pdf for additional
  documentation.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   dut.sv                         - The Hardware.
   simple_bus.sv                  - The simple_bus OVC.
   t.sv                           - Main classes. Top-level.
   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/05_backdoor_simple/

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print
   test.sv                        - A simple test
   
   dut_ABC.sv                     - Code to represent a piece of hardware
   dut_ABC_rf_pkg.sv              - The register and address map definitions
                                    for device "ABC".

   dut_XYZ.sv                     - Code to represent a piece of hardware
   dut_XYZ_rf_pkg.sv              - The register and address map definitions
                                    for device "XYZ".

   system_map_pkg.sv              - Code to build the register map that
                                    represents the system.
   t.sv                           - A tiny top level, instantiating the
                                    three hardware instances, and the bus.


-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/06_id_registers/  

  An example showing a "fancy" register who acts as a device ID.
  Successive reads return the next value in a sequence. Once the
  end of the sequence is reached the next value read is the first.
  This sequence of values is the "ID" of the device.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   t.sv                           - Simple test and top-level.
   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/08_register_field_modes/  

  An example showing a register who has two modes. The modes
  are captured by two different field definitions. Additionally,
  the modes have different coverage collected.

   makefile                       - Compile, Simulate, Print

   t.sv                           - Simple test and top-level.
   regdef.sv                      - The register definitions.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/08_register_field_modes_derived_class/  

  An alternate implementation with slightly different capabilities.
  The 08_register_field_modes example implementation is the 
  preferred implementation.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/09_memory_simple/  

  An example showing a simple memory use model. With
  this new functionality, a memory value can be written
  and read from the shadow represented by a memory map.
  There is also an implementation for "memory allocation",
  but this API, is not yet completely tested. The
  memory allocation functionality will be supported 
  in a future release.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/10_coherent_registers/  

  An example showing "master" and "slave" registers
  which act together to provide a coherent view of the
  slaves. When the master is read(), the slaves take
  a snapshot of themselves - effectively locking in the
  current values. Later, as time has passed, the snapshot
  values can be read, giving a consistent (coherent) picture
  of the values of the slaves when the snapshot was taken.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/11_masking_notification/  

  An example demonstrating the access policies and
  "aliasing" that a register can have. A register can
  be  "read-write" from one bus, and "read-only" from another
  bus.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/12_fifo_registers/  

  An example demonstrating the functionality of a fifo
  register.

-------------------------------------------------
o examples/registers/13_field_by_name/  

  An example demonstrating using a "by-name" access to
  set and get field values. This "field-by-name" access
  is demonstrated with a register definition file, and
  a few tests.

-------------------------------------------------
How to run the OVM Register examples:

 Change to the OVM REgister directory.

:   cd ovm_register-xxx/

 Change to the examples directory.
